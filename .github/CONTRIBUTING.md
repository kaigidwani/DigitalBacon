## Introduction

It is assumed that you know a little about Node.js and Git. If not, [here's some help to get started with Git](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git) and [hereâ€™s some help to get started with Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/)

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) DigitalBacon
* Open your OSâ€™s terminal
* Change into the directory youâ€™d like
* Clone your forked repo

      git clone https://github.com/[yourgithubname]/DigitalBacon.git

* Go into the DigitalBacon directory.

      cd ./DigitalBacon

* Install the dependencies

      npm install

## Next Steps

As per the npm standard, â€˜startâ€™ is the place to begin the package.

    npm start

This script will start a local server similar to [digitalbacon.io](https://digitalbacon.io/), but instead will be hosted on your local machine. Browse to https://localhost:8000/ to check it out

To verify that you are using a consistent coding style with the rest of the project, run:

      npm run lint

To run a test of the project to prevent regressions, run:

      npm test

If youâ€™d like to make a build of the source files (`build/DigitalBacon.js` and `build/DigitalBacon.min.js`) run:

    npm run build

## Making changes

When youâ€™ve decided to make changes, start with the following:

* Update your local repo

      git pull https://github.com/kalegd/DigitalBacon.git
      git push

* Make a new branch from the dev branch

      git checkout dev
      git branch [mychangesbranch]
      git checkout [mychangesbranch]

* Add your changes to your commit.
* Push the changes to your forked repo.
* Open a Pull Request (PR)

## Important notes:

* Don't include any build files in your commit
* Pull requests should be with respect to some GitHub issue. Please mention it with a hash (e.g. #2774), If there are no issues for your pull request, please create one first and verify it with the repo owner
* Pull requests should be made to the dev branch unless otherwise decided upon
* Making changes may require updates to the documentation in `/resources/`
* If you modify existing code or add new code, please perform manual testing to verify your changes don't break anything

This project is currently contributed to by everyone's spare time. Please keep that in mind as it may take some time for the appropriate feedback to get to you
